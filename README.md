# Film Stash backend
The backend for this project was originally made with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, but the model relationships were so trivial that I decided to shift away from a relational database and try out Node/Express with MongoDB.

You can see the frontend code here: https://github.com/doas-andrew/filmstash-frontend
